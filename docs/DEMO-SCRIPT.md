## [0:15 - 0:40] Onboarding Flow

**On Screen:** Walk through each onboarding screen in sequence:
1. Welcome screen with the Get Started button.
2. About You -- select family size, work status, and region.
3. Your Goals -- choose financial goals, set a grocery budget, and a savings target.
4. Notifications setup -- toggle preferences.

**Speaking Notes:**
"Getting started takes under a minute. You tell MumMoney about your family, your work situation, and your region. Then you pick your financial goals, set a weekly grocery budget, and choose a savings target. The app uses all of this to personalize every tip, swap, and recommendation you see. No two users get the same experience."

## [0:40 - 1:00] Home Screen

**On Screen:** The main dashboard. Highlight the savings total, the streak counter, the daily tip card, and the quick action buttons. Perform a pull-to-refresh gesture.

**Speaking Notes:**
"This is your home screen. Right at the top you can see your total savings so far and your current streak -- how many consecutive days you have logged a saving. Below that is a personalized daily tip based on your profile. The quick actions give you one-tap access to log a swap, browse recipes, or open a lesson. Pull down to refresh and the daily tip updates."

## [1:00 - 1:20] Smart Swaps

**Speaking Notes:**
"Smart Swaps is where real savings happen. Filter by category -- groceries, household, baby products, and more. Each swap shows you a brand-name product next to a recommended alternative, with the exact amount you save per swap. Tap to see full details, then log it. Your savings total updates instantly. These small swaps add up fast -- most mums save tens of pounds per week."

Every recipe shows you the cost per serving and the prep time upfront, so there are no surprises. Tap into a recipe to see the full ingredient list and step-by-step instructions. These are meals that are affordable, quick, and family-tested."

## [1:40 - 2:00] Learn to Invest

**On Screen:** Navigate to the Learn tab. Show the three learning levels. Tap into a lesson, scroll through the content, and tap the Mark Complete button. Show the progress bar updating on the Learn tab.

**Speaking Notes:**
"Learn to Invest breaks down investing into three levels -- Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level has bite-sized lessons written in plain language, no jargon. Open a lesson, read through it at your own pace, and mark it complete when you are done. Your progress bar updates so you can track how far you have come. The goal is to make investing feel approachable, not intimidating."
